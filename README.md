# Dynamic SVG NFT

### This project demonstrates the use of Scalable Vector Graphics to create dynamic NFT's. Chainlink price feeds (AggregatorV3Interface) is also utilized to provide real time pricing of assets which in turn will affect which SVG logo is displayed ("dynamic"). A mock contract (MockV3Aggregator) was also used to receive price feeds when running the project locally. Project was deployed locally using hardhat and to Rinkeby Network.
