Chainlink price feeds (AggregatorV3Interface) is also utilized to provide real time pricing of assets which in turn will affect which SVG logo is displayed ("dynamic"). A mock contract (MockV3Aggregator) was also used to receive price feeds when running the project locally. Project was deployed locally using hardhat and to Rinkeby Network.
